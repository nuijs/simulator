# simulator

Simulator is a web based solution to simulate 3D cameras, motion sensing devices for prototyping, developing and testing perceptual computing, augmented and virtual reality application without using a physical device. The simulator is purely based on JavaScript and easily integrates with the device's SDKs. Also, it is platform independent.

Using this simulator, people can conduct workshops, seminars for a larger audience who would be intending to learn a new technology, but wouldn't be having the required hardware (RealSense, Kinect, Leap Motion etc.)

This idea was first presented at JSConfAsia 2015, Singapore.
